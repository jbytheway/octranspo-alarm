Privacy policy
==============

Ride Ottawa has no dedicated servers.  The only data of yours that is stored is
your favourites, and that data is stored only on your device.  Of course, it
may also exist in any copies or backups you or your device may make of it.

Your location is used only locally within the app to suggest nearby stops and
never communicated to a third party.

Ride Ottawa does communicate to third-party servers.  It contacts
[GitHub](https://github.com/) to check for database updates, and the [OCTranspo
API](https://www.octranspo.com/en/plan-your-trip/travel-tools/developers/dev-terms/)
to determine bus times you request.  Both services will see your IP address,
and the OCTranspo service may be able to make inferences about your location
based on the stops and routes you query.
